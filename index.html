    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>
      <br>To begin using it, you need to allow access to your webcam in your browser. Click "allow” when asked if you want to give permission to access it.<br>

      <br> Right click on the button "click here!"<br>

      <br> Scroll down until you see the video of your camera and start moving your hand throughout the screen to begin triggering sounds.<br>

      <br> Get familiarized with the locations of the sounds in your screen and start improvising as you wish!<br>

      <br> Note: It is better if your face is out of the sight of the camera, so the system can properly track only your hand.<br>
